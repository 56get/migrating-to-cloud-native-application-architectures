# Summary

In this chapter we’ve examined the common motivations for movingto cloud-native application architectures in terms of abilities that wewant to provide to our business via software:

**Speed**

The ability to innovate, experiment, and deliver value more quickly than our competitors.

**Safety**

The ability to move rapidly but also maintain stability, availability, and durability.

**Scale**

The ability to elastically respond to changes in demand.

**Mobility**

The ability for our customers to interact with us seamlessly from any location, on any device, and at any time.

We’ve also examined the unique characteristics of cloud-native application architectures and how they can help us provide these abilities:

**Twelve-factor applications**

A set of patterns that optimize application design for speed, safety, and scale.

**Microservices**

An architecture pattern that helps us align our units of deployment with business capabilities, allowing each capability to move independently and autonomously, and in turn faster and safer.

**Self-service agile infrastructure**

Cloud platforms that enable development teams to operate at an application and service abstraction level, providing infrastructure-level speed, safety, and scale.

**API-based collaboration**

An architecture pattern that defines service-to-service interaction as automatically verifiable contracts, enabling speed and safety through simplified integration work.

**Antifragility**

As we increase stress on the system via speed and scale, the system improves its ability to respond, increasing safety.

In the next chapter we’ll examine a few of the changes that most enterprises will need to make in order to adopt cloud-native application architectures.
